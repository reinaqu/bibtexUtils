	abstract = {The recent growth of the blockchain technology market puts its main cryptocurrencies in the spotlight. Among them, Ethereum stands out due to its virtual machine (EVM) supporting smart contracts, i.e., distributed programs that control the flow of the digital currency Ether. Being written in a Turing complete language, Ethereum smart contracts allow for expressing a broad spectrum of financial applications. The price for this expressiveness, however, is a significant semantic complexity, which increases the risk of programming errors. Recent attacks exploiting bugs in smart contract implementations call for the design of formal verification techniques for smart contracts. This, however, requires rigorous semantic foundations, a formal characterization of the expected security properties, and dedicated abstraction techniques tailored to the specific EVM semantics. This work will overview the state-of-the-art in smart contract verification, covering formal semantics, security definitions, and verification tools. We will then focus on EtherTrust [1], a framework for the static analysis of Ethereum smart contracts which includes the first complete small-step semantics of EVM bytecode, the first formal characterization of a large class of security properties for smart contracts, and the first static analysis for EVM bytecode that comes with a proof of soundness. © The Author(s) 2018.},

	abstract = {At a time when society is in constant transition to keep up with technological advancement, we are seeing traditional paradigms being increasingly challenged. The fundamentals of governance are one such paradigm. As society's values have shifted, so have expectations of government shifted from the traditional model to something commonly referred to as 'open governance'. Though a disputed term, we take open governance to mean a concept, which encourages and facilitates openness, accountability, and responsiveness to citizens. For the success of open governance initiatives, there are some technologies, such as the internet, that are crucial. These technologies enable access to both the data and to engagement activities between citizens and government. There are also other technologies, like blockchain and smart contacts, which could be utilised to assist open governance. A sound starting point would be moving from a system where information is tediously released by a government, on an 'as they please' basis, to an infrastructure where critical actions are captured with strong integrity, non-repudiation and evidential guarantees. With an added dimension that facilitates these actions record be accessible to public scrutiny in near realtime. One candidate technology for capturing such actions is blockchain. Initially, blockchains were mainly used to facilitate cryptocurrencies as a record of transactions. The notable example being bitcoin. However, in recent years, blockchains utility is being recognised through smart contracts - potentially a vital building block to realising open and transparent government activities. In this paper, we employ the concept of smart contracts to government tendering activities. The proposed scheme is based on smart contracts, enabling a fair, transparent and independently verifiable (auditable) government tendering scheme. The scheme is then implemented on the Ethereum platform to evaluate the performance and financial cost implications, along with an evaluation of the potential security and auditability challenges. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A smart contract enforces specific performance on anonymous users without centralization. It facilitates payment equity in commerce by providing irreversible transactions. Smart contracts are also used for illegal activities such as money laundering and ransomware. Such contracts include criminal smart contracts (CSCs), proposed in CCS’16, that can be efficiently implemented in existing scripting languages. This aggravates concerns about the dangers of CSCs. However, PublicLeaks, a CSC for leaking private data, is conditionally implemented as it is influenced by various factors. For example, PublicLeaks does not necessarily reach a desirable terminal state for a criminal leaking private information, and other possible terminal states may invalidate the CSC. In this study, we propose a CSC based on PublicLeaks by formulating random factors such as the donation ratio. Our contract forks into five terminal states, including a unique one in PublicLeaks due to randomness. We simulated the maximal probabilities of these terminal states and found that the desirable terminal state in PublicLeaks is reachable with low probabilities (lower than 25%). The terminal state where the criminal fails to leak private information is attained with relatively high probabilities (over 65%). Therefore, our simulations show that CSCs are not always as powerful as expected, and the risk posed by them can be mitigated. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {In recent publications, we presented a novel formal symbolic process virtual machine (FSPVM) framework that combined higher-order logic theorem proving and symbolic execution for verifying the reliability and security of smart contracts developed in the Ethereum blockchain system without suffering from standard issues surrounding reusability, consistency, and automation. A specific FSPVM, denoted as FSPVM-E, was developed in Coq based on a general, extensible, and reusable formal memory framework, an extensible and universal formal intermediate programming language, denoted as Lolisa, and a corresponding formally verified interpreter for Lolisa, denoted as FEther. However, our past work has demonstrated that the execution efficiency of the standard development of FEther is extremely low. As a result, FSPVM-E fails to achieve its expected verification effect. This paper addresses this issue by first identifying three root causes of the low execution efficiency of formal interpreters. We then build abstract models of these causes, and present respective optimization schemes for rectifying the identified conditions. Finally, we apply these optimization schemes to FEther, and demonstrate that its execution efficiency has been improved significantly. © 2013 IEEE.},

Blockchains can serve as an technology enabler, but to reach their best potential blockchains need to tackle new business needs. MaaS ecosystems form an excellent arena for this. We present a model of a MaaS ecosystem, enabling easy, quick and trusted transactions taking advantage of artificial intelligence and blockchain-enabled smart contracts. We also present a subset demonstration of this model, TravelToken, which utilizes QR code that stores and uses travel information in smart contract over Ethereum. The benefits are that all travel data can be stored in one ticket, information stays unaltered in blockchain, and value-share as well as compensations in case of delays will be automatic. © 2018 IEEE.},

A blockchain is a kind of distributed computer technology in which all nodes have the same ledger to guarantee data integrity. Within a blockchain, smart contract defines the contexts of various items in the form of program code and acts as business logic. However, studies on existing smart contracts do not focus on formalizing rules themselves or managing conditional according to various situations. In this study, we formalize data related to smart contract and propose a method to apply conditional to various situation. This method models data of smart contract using ontology and applies semantic web rule language to conditional and manages rule sets in blockchain network. In this way interoperability of the smart contract type can be ensured and the relationship between the contexts in each transaction can be inferred by linking the ontology reasoner to the blockchain network. We describe the smart contract applying the semantic web rule language and show how to actually operate within the blockchain network through the program example. © Medwell Journals, 2018.},

Over the years after the revolution in the digital transaction space, we are looking at major scalability issue with old POW consensus method and bitcoin peak limit of processing only 7 transactions per second. With more companies trying to adopt blockchain to modify their existing systems, blockchain working on old consensus methods and with scalability issues can't deliver the optimal solution. Specifically, with new trends like smart contracts and DAPPs, much better performance is needed to support any actual business applications. Such requirements are pushing the new platforms away from old methods of consensus and adoption of off-chain solutions. In this paper, we discuss various scalability issues with the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain and recent proposals like the lighting protocol, sharding, super quadratic sharding, DPoS to solve these issues. We also draw the comparison between these proposals on their ability to overcome scalability limits and highlighting major problems in these approaches. In the end, we propose our solution to suffice the scalability issue and conclude with the fact that with better scalability, blockchain has the potential to outrageously support varied domains of the industry. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A developing field of interest for the distributed systems and applied cryptography communities is that of smart contracts: Self-executing financial instruments that synchronize their state, often through a blockchain. One such smart contract system that has seen widespread practical adoption is Ethereum, which has grown to a market capacity of 100 billion USD and clears an excess of 500,000 daily transactions. Unfortunately, the rise of these technologies has been marred by a series of costly bugs and exploits. Increasingly, the Ethereum community has turned to formal methods and rigorous program analysis tools. This trend holds great promise due to the relative simplicity of smart contracts and bounded-time deterministic execution inherent to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Here we present KEVM, an executable formal specification of the EVM's bytecode stack-based language built with the K Framework, designed to serve as a solid foundation for further formal analyses. We empirically evaluate the correctness and performance of KEVM using the official Ethereum test suite. To demonstrate the usability, several extensions of the semantics are presented. and two different-language implementations of the ERC20 Standard Token are verified against the ERC20 specification. These results are encouraging for the executable semantics approach to language prototyping and specification. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The success of the Ethereum blockchain as a decentralized application platform with a distributed consensus protocol has made many organizations start to invest into running their business on top of it. Technically, the most impressive feature behind the success of Ethereum is its support for a Turing complete language. On the other hand, the inherent transparency and, consequently, the lack of privacy poses a great challenge for many financial applications. In this paper, we tackle this challenge and present a smart contract for a verifiable sealed-bid auction on the Ethereum blockchain. In a nutshell, initially, the bidders submit homomorphic commitments to their sealed-bids on the contract. Subsequently, they reveal their commitments secretly to the auctioneer via a public key encryption scheme. Then, according to the auction rules, the auctioneer determines and claims the winner of the auction. Finally, we utilize interactive zero-knowledge proof protocols between the smart contract and the auctioneer to verify the correctness of such a claim. The underlying protocol of the proposed smart contract is partially privacy-preserving. To be precise, no information about the losing bids is leaked to the bidders. We provide an analysis of the proposed protocol and the smart contract design, in addition to the estimated gas costs associated with the different transactions. © International Financial Cryptography Association 2019.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin continues to get more and more attention from the media, mainly because of the volatility of its value and insignificantly associated with the technological innovation. This cryptocurrency is supported by an immutable database and is distributed throughout a network of thousands of nodes, known as Blockchain. One way to ensure that all the concepts behind the Blockchain technology and infrastructure are seized is to conduct the development of one of the most popular context applications for it: a wallet for well-known cryptocurrencies. Yet Another Bitcoin Wallet (YABW) is a hybrid application available for both Android and iOS, which was developed with the Ionic and Angular frameworks. This application communicates with Bitcoin Blockchain to send, receive and store bitcoins; provides a set of features focused on security and user experience, and is available on the Play Store and Apple Store. A rather relevant issue that is becoming a major subject of current research is the application of the Blockchain infrastructure to other contexts that are neither directly connected to cryptocurrencies, nor are finance related. The implementation of a proof-of-concept application proposes the use of a blockchain for a specific case study: the exchange of meal vouchers of an institution amongst students. This is achieved using the decentralized platform Ethereum, which allows us to create a Smart Contract using the Solidity programming language to create a token that follows the Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC), the ERC-20 standard and represents the meal vouchers. This second application uses the architecture defined for YABW, reusing major components and custom developing specific modules to enhance the required features. There is still a lot of research to be done on the non-financial applicability of the Blockchain infrastructure and technology, but for the moment, we have left further evidence that it is possible and is a relative straight-forward process to accomplish from the technological perspective. © 2018 by the authors.},

This solution is based on utilizing Ethereum smart contracts to govern and regulate the document version control functions among the creators and developers of the document and its validators. Moreover, our solution leverages the benefits of IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to store documents on a decentralized file system. The proposed solution automates necessary interactions among multiple actors comprising developers and approvers. Smart contracts have been developed using Solidity language, and their functionalities were tested using the Remix IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

Since the Event Calculus deals with local events and the consideration of time, it enables the uniform representation of basic-, conditional and persistent commitments, including its operations and reasoning rules about them. Due to the similarities between event, action and state processing and reaction rules, we extend KR ReactionRuleML to emphasize syntax and semantics relevant for commitments, called CommitRuleML. CommitRuleML is used to define commitment-based smart contracts (CBSCs) as contracts that logically (through the Event Calculus) define events (on), conditions (if) and actions (do) in an executable language. A simplified running example illustrates how commitments evolve and fulfill over time. © 2019 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts, as a promising and powerful application on the Ethereum blockchain, have been growing rapidly in the past few years. Since they are highly vulnerable to different forms of attacks, their security becomes a top priority. However, existing security auditing techniques are either limited in finding vulnerabilities (rely on pre-defined bug patterns) or very expensive (rely on program analysis), thus are insufficient for Ethereum. To mitigate these limitations, we proposed a novel semantic-aware security auditing technique called S-gram for Ethereum. The key insight is a combination of N-gram language modeling and lightweight static semantic labeling, which can learn statistical regularities of contract tokens and capture high-level semantics as well (e.g., flow sensitivity of a transaction). S-gram can be used to predict potential vulnerabilities by identifying irregular token sequences and optimize existing in-depth analyzers (e.g., symbolic execution engines, fuzzers etc.). We have implemented S-gram for Solidity smart contracts in Ethereum. The evaluation demonstrated the potential of S-gram in identifying possible security issues. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

The current situation is felt problematic due to the fragmented tools and services often organized in silos to meet a traveler needs to undertake a trip. One of the major concerns designing any platform system like Mobility as a Service is where to start modeling and how to express the notion of the platform system in some language that is understandable for all stakeholders of the platform system. Understandability buttresses the expectation of stakeholders whether some design will probably implement the intended platform services enabling users to actually buy and or use the platform system for what ever purpose. Building on the economic theories of two-sided markets and mechanism design we introduce the concept of value nets extending the Contract Protocol Net. Value net modeling offers a precise abstract representation which provides in the detailed informational requirements in a canonical form and it connects i.e. implements the abstract notion of Service Oriented Architecture characterizing systems without loss of crucial informational elements. ? 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 License.},

	abstract = {In addition to functionalities, business process management (BPM) involves several key indicators such as openness, security, flexibility, and scalability. Optimizing system performance is becoming a great challenge for an ever-increasing large-scale distributed application system in the digital economy on the Internet of Things (IoT) era. In a centralized BPM, many indicators, such as security and openness, or cost and flexibility, are conflicting with each other. For example, inviting new partners across enterprises, domains, and regions to form a service workflow exposes new risks and needs additional security mechanisms for scrutiny; enhancing the flexibility of business workflow compositions increases the cost of security assurance. Blockchain technology (BCT) has thrown the light on the development of vital solutions to various BPM problems. BCT has to be integrated with other BPM system components that often involve IoT devices to implement specified functionalities related to the application. Currently, the potentials of using BCT have been explored although still at an early stage. In this paper, the states of the art are presented to identify emerging research topics, challenges, and promising applications in integrating BCT into the development of BPM. IEEE},

	abstract = {The capability of executing so-called smart contracts in a decentralised manner is one of the compelling features of modern blockchains. Smart contracts are fully fledged programs which cannot be changed once deployed to the blockchain. They typically implement the business logic of distributed apps and carry billions of dollars worth of coins. In that respect, it is imperative that smart contracts are correct and have no vulnerabilities or bugs. However, research has identified different classes of vulnerabilities in smart contracts, some of which led to prominent multi-million dollar fraud cases. In this paper we focus on vulnerabilities related to integer bugs, a class of bugs that is particularly difficult to avoid due to some characteristics of the Ethereum Virtual Machine and the Solidity programming language. In this paper we introduce OSIRIS - a framework that combines symbolic execution and taint analysis, in order to accurately find integer bugs in Ethereum smart contracts. Osiris detects a greater range of bugs than existing tools, while providing a better speci-ficity of its detection. We have evaluated its performance on a large experimental dataset containing more than 1.2 million smart contracts. We found that 42,108 contracts contain integer bugs. Besides being able to identify several vulnerabilities that have been reported in the past few months, we were also able to identify a yet unknown critical vulnerability in a couple of smart contracts that are currently deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

In this paper, we focus on reasoning about execution traces of smart contracts. We report on our preliminary results of mechanically verifying some of such properties by embedding a smart contract language into the Coq proof assistant. We also discuss several common scenarios, all of which require multi-step blockchain-based arbitration and thus must be implemented via stateful contracts, and discuss possible temporal specifications of the corresponding smart contract implementations. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

	abstract = {Could smart contracts written in Solidity, a popular language among blockchain developers for Ethereum, be run on other blockchain platforms such as Hyperleger Fabric. To run Solidity smart contracts on another blockchain platform, one can either incorporate the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in the target blockchain, or perform a source-to-source translation of the Solidity contracts to a smart contract language for the target platform. This paper presents Sol2js, an open source source-to-source translation tool that generates Javascript smart contracts for Hyperledger Fabric from Solidity contracts, and provides a conceptual mapping of Ethereum constructs to that of Hyperleger Fabric, where possible. Presently, the tool is able to successfully translate 65-70% of Solidity constructs including major types, functions, inheritance, and events. The preliminary results show that the average of the lines of code (loc) across translated contracts is 7.5x more than the average of Solidity contracts loc while preserving contract semantics. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Ethereum is a major blockchain-based platform for smart contracts - Turing complete programs that are executed in a decentralized network and usually manipulate digital units of value. Solidity is the most mature high-level smart contract language. Ethereum is a hostile execution environment, where anonymous attackers exploit bugs for immediate financial gain. Developers have a very limited ability to patch deployed contracts. Hackers steal up to tens of millions of dollars from flawed contracts, a well-known example being "The DAO", broken in June 2016. Advice on secure Ethereum programming practices is spread out across blogs, papers, and tutorials. Many sources are outdated due to a rapid pace of development in this field. Automated vulnerability detection tools, which help detect potentially problematic language constructs, are still underdeveloped in this area. We provide a comprehensive classification of code issues in Solidity and implement SmartCheck - an extensible static analysis tool that detects them 1 . SmartCheck translates Solidity source code into an XML-based intermediate representation and checks it against XPath patterns. We evaluated our tool on a big dataset of real-world contracts and compared the results with manual audit on three contracts. Our tool reflects the current state of knowledge on Solidity vulnerabilities and shows significant improvements over alternatives. SmartCheck has its limitations, as detection of some bugs requires more sophisticated techniques such as taint analysis or even manual audit. We believe though that a static analyzer should be an essential part of contract developers' toolbox, letting them fix simple bugs fast and allocate more effort to complex issues. © 2018 ACM.},

For these reasons, smart contracts are an appealing opportunity for systematic auditing and validation, and formal methods in particular.

The design of Simplicity makes it possible to statically estimate the resources (e.g., memory) required to execute contracts. Such a feature is highly relevant in blockchain applications to efficiently determine fees to run smart contracts. Despite being Turing incomplete, the language is capable of expressing non-trivial contracts. Often, Simplicity programs contain lots of code repetition that could otherwise be avoided if it had common programming languages features, such as local definitions, functions, and bounded loops. In this work, we provide the foundations to make Simplicity a richer language. To achieve that, we connect Simplicity’s primitives with a categorical model. By doing so, we lift the language to a more abstract representation that will allow us to extend it by leveraging category theory models for computations. This methodology facilitates the addition of local definitions, functions, and bounded loops. We provide an implementation of Simplicity and its virtual machine in the functional programming language Haskell. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

	abstract = {There is no doubt that the revolutionary concept of the blockchain, which is the underlying technology behind the famous cryptocurrency Bitcoin and its successors, is triggering the start of a new era in the Internet and the online services. While most people focus only at cryptocurrencies; in fact, many administrative operations, fintech procedures, and everyday services that can only be done offline and/or in person, can now safely be moved to the Internet as online services. What makes it a powerful tool for digitalizing everyday services is the introduction of smart contracts, as in the Ethereum platform. Smart contracts are meaningful pieces of codes, to be integrated in the blockchain and executed as scheduled in every step of blockchain updates. E-voting on the other hand, is another trending, yet critical, topic related to the online services. The blockchain with the smart contracts, emerges as a good candidate to use in developments of safer, cheaper, more secure, more transparent, and easier-to-use e-voting systems. Ethereum and its network is one of the most suitable ones, due to its consistency, widespread use, and provision of smart contracts logic. An e-voting system must be secure, as it should not allow duplicated votes and be fully transparent, while protecting the privacy of the attendees. In this work, we have implemented and tested a sample e-voting application as a smart contract for the Ethereum network using the Ethereum wallets and the Solidity language. Android platform is also considered to allow voting for people who do not have an Ethereum wallet. After an election is held, eventually, the Ethereum blockchain will hold the records of ballots and votes. Users can submit their votes via an Android device or directly from their Ethereum wallets, and these transaction requests are handled with the consensus of every single Ethereum node. This consensus creates a transparent environment for e-voting. In addition to a broad discussion about reliability and efficiency of the blockchain-based e-voting systems, our application and its test results are presented in this paper, too. © 2018 IEEE.},

The engineering of such hybrid software architectures poses a challenge as it is unclear which elements should be centralized or decentralized. Furthermore the impact of this decision (or the balance between those two areas) on software quality attributes such as security, maintainability, performance or costs is currently unknown. The goal is to build a software architecture using the benefits and handling the challenges of blockchain technology while fulfilling the relevant quality attributes. While there are several approaches examining the relation between architectural decisions and quality attributes in centralized systems, research is at an early stage for decentralized elements in software architectures. This paper presents a first step towards architectural blockchain tactics. With a simplified experiment comparing two implementation variants of an Ethereum smart contract we show that software design patterns are not always beneficial and that the expected usage scenarios have a strong impact on the operational costs. We argue that further research and validation is necessary for gaining more qualitative and quantitative insights to make informed architectural design decisions when using blockchain technology and give a first outline on how to achieve this. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is a decentralized ledger technology, and it is the technology underlying Bitcoin and Ethereum. The interest in blockchain has been increasing since its emergence. Hyperledger Fabric is one of the permissioned blockchain frameworks. One of the characteristics of Hyperledger Fabric is it utilizes general-purpose programming languages, e.g., Go, Node.js, and Java, to implement smart contracts (called chaincode in Hyperledger Fabric). The advantages of utilizing these languages are already known to potential developers, and development tools might already exist. However, one of the disadvantages is that these languages were not originally designed for writing smart contracts. Hence, there may be risks that developers do not need to consider when using specific languages such as Solidity of Ethereum. Furthermore, even though development tools exist, how many risks are covered by the tools is an open question. In this paper, we focus on Go language and the tools. First, we surveyed what kind of risks are associated with chaincodes are developed using Go language and observed there are 14 potential risks. Then, we investigated how many risks can be covered by Go tools, e.g., golint and gosec, and a vulnerability detection tool for chaincodes called Chaincode Scanner. From our results, we observed that some risks are not covered by the existing tools. Hence, we develop a detection tool to cover risks by static analysis. Finally, in this paper, we describe how to find the risks with our tool and evaluate the usefulness. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Permissionless blockchains allow the execution of arbitrary programs (called smart contracts), enabling mutually untrusted entities to interact without relying on trusted third parties. Despite their potential, repeated security concerns have shaken the trust in handling billions of USD by smart contracts. To address this problem, we present Securify, a security analyzer for Ethereum smart contracts that is scalable, fully automated, and able to prove contract behaviors as safe/unsafe with respect to a given property. Securify’s analysis consists of two steps. First, it symbolically analyzes the contract’s dependency graph to extract precise semantic information from the code. Then, it checks compliance and violation patterns that capture sufficient conditions for proving if a property holds or not. To enable extensibility, all patterns are specified in a designated domain-specific language. Securify is publicly released, it has analyzed > 18K contracts submitted by its users, and is regularly used to conduct security audits by experts. We present an extensive evaluation of Securify over real-world Ethereum smart contracts and demonstrate that it can effectively prove the correctness of smart contracts and discover critical violations. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

First, we give a systematic introduction for smart contracts, including the basic framework, operating mechanisms, platforms and programming languages. Second, application scenarios and existing challenges are discussed. Finally, we describe the recent advances of smart contract and present its future development trends, e.g., parallel blockchain.

Therefore, the security of the blockchain smart contracts is among the most popular contemporary research topics. To improve the theorem-proving technology in this field, we are developing an extensible hybrid verification proof engine, denoted as FEther, for Ethereum smart contract verification. Based on Lolisa, which is a large subset of solidity mechanized in Coq, FEther guarantees the consistency between smart contracts and its formal model. Combining symbolic execution with higher order logic theorem-proving, FEther contains a set of automatic strategies that execute and verify the smart contracts in Coq with a high level of automation. Besides, in FEther, the verified code segments also can be reused to assist in the verification of other properties. The functional correctness of FEther was verified in Coq. The execution efficiency of FEther has far exceeded that of the interpreters that are developed in Coq in accordance with the standard tutorial. To the best of our knowledge, FEther is the first definitional interpreter of the solidity language in Coq. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Steve Saxby's prescient founding of CLSR, two hundred issues ago, encouraged and resonated with my own digital visionary thinking and professional activity in the evolving field of ICT and the Law. From Infolex, the UK's first commercially-available computer-assisted legal information retrieval service, and my APPEAL Report (on the admissibility of computer evidence in court and the legal reliability/security of IT systems), via my Forensic Systems Analysis expert methodology, to the nascent CryptoBlockTV, Steve's scholarly foresight in promoting adventurous exploration of ‘digilaw’ high-ground topics and issues has presented me with opportunities to generate a stream of prescient material, for which I am immensely grateful. And what is beyond prescient today is that the Coming of the Robots is unstoppable. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Age is upon us; RoboJudge has all but already arrived. While many are concerned about defining and developing Machine Ethics, Castell's Second Dictum: “You cannot construct an algorithm that will reliably decide whether or not any algorithm is ethical” reveals that this is a futile exercise. Algorithms are also pivotal to the current mania for Crypto-Algorithmic Blockchain Technology Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), with a ‘Crypto Tribe’ of Millennials relentlessly raising billions in real money thereby, to the extent that I have dubbed Crypto the Millennials’ Rock'n'Roll. The seasoned ICT expert professional however bears in mind that there are as yet no ISO standards for blockchain, and there is far more to creating and delivering a complete quality-assured system than just the blockchain component. Furthermore, the legal status of cryptocurrency, smart contract and distributed ledger technology is not clear or uncontentious – and there is already ICO litigation on foot. Nevertheless, taking my limerick-writing Castell GhostWriteBot's advice, it is perhaps time for my own asset-linked ICO, to launch my CapChere.com concept designed to reboot Capitalism and achieve ubiquitous universal share and wealth ownership.

In particular, we start by exploring some of the advantages of these technologies, specifically the immutability of blockchains and automated contract remittance. We also discuss two critical shortcomings of decentralized smart contracts, namely regulatory uncertainty and a lack of confidential execution. With these issues in mind, we next explore how American legislators have begun to address smart contracts and blockchains. Though quite limited, there have been a few provisions clarifying the status of these technologies. We break down some of the language expressed in these bills so as to understand the current legal status of smart contracts and blockchains. Given this foundation, we consider the next steps that should be taken as smart contracts mature. This pertains to both the continued improvement of the underlying technology as well as the progress taken by regulators. Finally, assuming a futuristic scenario where there are no technological or regulatory barriers to smart contract adoption, we discuss how the process of contract remittance can be expedited in a world fully committed to the use of smart contracts. © 2018 IEEE.},

In this paper, the constituent elements of smart contract are analyzed and expressed by ontology. And the process of negotiating the components is represented by each transaction. Finally, we construct the component represented by the ontology as XML by including the state information in the transaction.

It has to be integrated with other Business Process Management system (BPM) components to implement specified functionalities related to the applications. The current efforts in integrating this technology into BPM are at a very early stage. To apply Blockchain into business processes efficiently, Blockchain and business process characteristics must be identified. Inconsistency of confirmation settlement that heavily relies on the implementation of consensus protocol poses a major challenge in business process operations, especially ones that are time-critical. In addition, validators, nodes responsible for performing consensus operations in a Blockchain system, can introduce bias and as a result are not trustable. This paper first defines Blockchain and also investigates the characteristics of Blockchain and business processes. Then, we suggest an architecture of business processes in Blockchain era to overcome the problems of time inconsistency and consensus bias. The architecture provides persistency, validity, auditability, and disintermediary that Blockchain offers. The architecture also provides flexibility by allowing business partner to select nodes in performing consensus; thus bias is mitigated. © 2018},

	abstract = {An ICO (Initial Coin Offering) is an innovative way to fund projects based on blockchain. The funding is based on the selling of tokens by means of decentralized applications called smart contracts written in Solidity, a programming language specific for Ethereum blockchain. The ICOs work in a volatile context and it is crucial that the team is capable of handling constant changes. The Agile methods, proven practices enabling to develop software in presence of changing requirements, could be a means for managing uncertainty. The main goals of this work are to understand software engineering activities related to ICOs, recognize the ICOs developed using Agile methods, and make a comparison between ICOs and Agile ICOs. In addition, we perform a deeper analysis of Agile ICOs concerning project planning, software development, and code features. Our work shows that the roles of the people involved in an ICO can be compared to the typical roles of the SCRUM methodology. The majority of Agile ICOs use tool of testing before storing smart contract on blockchain. Finally, the application of volumetric and complexity software metrics shows that the files of Agile ICOs is on average shorter and less complex than in other smart contracts. © 2018 by the authors.},

Our motivation is to assert, using relevant features of Idris, that such an implementation possesses some of the accepted properties of blockchains. This paper first presents some differences between our implementation and most real-world blockchains. Next the Idris language and some of its features are discussed, focusing on how the language is used to implement the simulation.

	abstract = {Traditional database management systems are controlled by a single entity, because the data in the databases cannot be fully trusted by all participants in a multi-party collaboration scenario, each participant must maintain a separate database that hosts its own business data, the discrepancies on each participant's databases lead to slowdowns of manual reconciliation and some disputes. Blockchain can solve the problem of trust among multiple participants. Blockchain is a decentralized, trustless, tamper-proof and traceable distributed database managed by multiple participants. A blockchain also called distributed ledger, is essentially an append-only data structure maintained by a set of nodes which do not fully trust each other. Nodes in the blockchain keep replicas of the blocks, each containing an ordered set of transactions modifying the states. All nodes agree on the transactions and their order. Traditional databases assume a trusted environment. Blockchain's key property is that it assumes nodes behave in arbitrary manner. Being able to tolerate Byzantine failure by consensus protocol, blockchain establishes a reliable trust between both parties of the transaction, and implements trusted data sharing and peer-to-peer value exchange without third-party intermediaries. The blockchain's consensus protocol must tolerate Byzantine failures. This is not the case in traditional distributed systems, in which they use the Paxos or Raft consensus protocol. There are many variants of consensus protocols being developed for blockchains. They can be classified into two kinds. One consists of purely computation based protocols that use proof of computation to randomly select a node which decides the next block. PoW is the prime example. The other are purely communication based protocols in which nodes have equal votes and go through multiple rounds of communication to reach consensus. PBFT is the prime example. A blockchain system can be categorized as either public or consortium. In the former, any node can join and leave the system. In the latter, the blockchain enforces strict membership. There is an access control mechanism to determine who can join the system. PoW are used in public blockchains because they are fully decentralized, and PBFT are used in consortium blockchains because they assume authenticated nodes. Bitcoin is the most successful blockchain application. Ethereum is the most widely used platform in public blockchains. Hyperledger Fabric is the most widely used platform in consortium blockchains. This paper proposes an architecture model of the blockchain system based on the above three mainstream blockchain platforms. This paper then discusses the principles and technologies of blockchain according to blockchain data, consensus mechanism, smart contract, scalability and security. Specifically, blockchain data is introduced from three aspects of data structure, data model and datastore, consensus mechanism is discussed about PoW applied in public blockchains and PBFT applied in consortium blockchains, smart contract is described from three aspects of running mechanism, programing language and sandbox, blockchain scalability is analyzed about sharding and multichannel, blockchain security is discussed from digital signing and verification, and privacy preserving. This paper also analyzes the advantages, disadvantages and technology trends of blockchain by comparing with traditional databases, and gives several challenging research problems for blockchain. The development of blockchain will bring both challenges and opportunities for many industries, and result in the second generation of the digital revolution bringing us the Internet of Value. © 2018, Science Press.

These smart contracts are used to handle tokens of value, can be accessed and analyzed by everyone and are immutable once deployed. Those characteristics make it imperative that smart contracts are bug-free at deployment time, hence the need to verify them formally. In this paper we describe our current efforts in building an SMT-based formal verification module within the compiler of Solidity, a popular language for writing smart contracts. The tool is seamlessly integrated into the compiler, where during compilation, the user is automatically warned of and given counterexamples for potential arithmetic overflow/underflow, unreachable code, trivial conditions, and assertion fails. We present how the component currently translates a subset of Solidity into SMT statements using different theories, and discuss future challenges such as multi-transaction and state invariants. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

Today's smart contracts are coded in non-mainstream procedural programming languages (e.g. Solidity for Ethereum), which lifts the requirement to draft enterprise ready smart contract to both a legal professional and a programmer instead of only the former. In search for a smart contract language that reduces the threshold to draft one, this conceptual paper elaborates how business logic can be converted to executable code for commitment-based smart contracts. Hereby, a contract is viewed as a set of reciprocal commitments. The smart contract ensures the automated execution of all or most of these commitments.

	abstract = {Blockchain technology enables the execution of collaborative business processes involving mutually untrusted parties. Existing tools allow such processes to be modeled using high-level notations and compiled into smart contracts that can be deployed on blockchain platforms. However, these tools brush aside the question of who is allowed to execute which tasks in the process, either by deferring the question altogether or by adopting a static approach where all actors are bound to roles upon process instantiation. Yet, a key advantage of blockchains is their ability to support dynamic sets of actors. This paper presents a model for dynamic binding of actors to roles in collaborative processes and an associated binding policy specification language. The proposed language is endowed with a Petri net semantics, thus enabling policy consistency verification. The paper also outlines an approach to compile policy specifications into smart contracts for enforcement. An experimental evaluation shows that the cost of policy enforcement increases linearly with the number of roles and constraints. &#x00A9; 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Smart contracts facilitate trust-less systems, without the need for intervention from third-party intermediaries. Existing smart-contract languages mainly focus on technical utility and do not take into consideration social and legally relevant issues, e.g., lack of semantics, ontological completeness, and so on. In this research, we address the gap by developing with rigorous means a smart contract's language that aims to be legally relevant, and that comprises socio-technical utility for cross-organizational business collaboration. The proposed language seeks to retain the strengths of the already existing languages of different generations while eluding their limitations. We aim to identify and implement abstract grammar patterns for a smart-contract language that has the expected application utility and verifiability. We evaluate the developed language based on automating industry-collaboration cases with our novel smart-contract language to test the suitability, utility, and expressiveness. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Scalability and privacy are two challenges for today's blockchain systems. Processing transactions at every node in the system limits the system's ability to scale. Furthermore, the requirement to publish all corporate or individual information for processing at every node, essentially making the data public, is-despite of all other advantages-often considered a major obstacle to blockchain adoption. In this paper, we make two main contributions to address these two problems: (i)To increase efficiency, we propose a processing model which employs noninteractive proofs to off-chain computations, thereby reducing on-chain computational efforts to the verification of correctness of execution rather than the execution itself. Due to the verifiable computation scheme's zero-knowledge property, private information used in the off-chain computation does not have to become public to verify correctness. (ii)We introduce ZoKrates, a toolbox to specify, integrate and deploy such off-chain computations. It consists of a domain-specific language, a compiler, and generators for proofs and verification Smart Contracts. ZoKrates hides significant complexity inherent to zero-knowledge proofs, provides a more familiar and higher level of programming abstractions to developers and enables circuit integration, hence fostering adoption. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The notion of smart contracts in distributed ledger systems have been hailed as a safe way of enforcing contracts between participating parties. However, unlike legal contracts, which talk about ideal behaviour and consequences of not adhering to such behaviour, smart contracts are by their very nature executable code, giving explicit instructions on how to achieve compliance. Executable specification languages, particularly Turing complete ones, are notoriously known for the difficulty of ensuring correctness, and recent incidents which led to huge financial losses due to bugs in smart contracts, have highlighted this issue. In this paper we show how standard techniques from runtime verification can be used in the domain of smart contracts, including a novel stake-based instrumentation technique which ensures that the violating party provides insurance for correct behaviour. The techniques we describe have been partially implemented in a proof-of-concept tool ContractLarva, which we discuss in this paper. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recently, despite the growing popularity of smart contracts, one serious concern is arising among both industry and academia, that is, whether they work autonomously without human intervention really as intended and, when we are not sure, how we can ensure that contracts meet particular requirements. To resolve this, we propose a new formal approach to smart contract development: Instead of defining contracts just as programs in conventional languages, they should be defined using formal logic so that we can verify whether they meet particular requirements and enforce them if necessary. The primary challenge is that expressive formal logic often turns out to be undecidable and consequently executable programs cannot be generated. As a solution, each contract definition is divided into two layers, namely specification layer in a decidable logic called Linear Dynamic Logic for verification and enforcement of requirements and rule layer for defining implementation details, while the consistency between the two layers is systematically guaranteed. Based on this, it also becomes possible to automatically generate executable contract programs from their formal specification, which leads to improving the trustworthiness of contracts. Evaluation on Hyperledger Fabric shows the feasibility and high effectiveness of our approach. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) is a modular and extensible permissioned blockchain platform released to open-source and hosted by the Linux Foundation. The platform's design exhibits principles required by enterprise grade business applications like supply-chains, nancial transactions, asset management, food safety, and many more. For that end HLF introduces several innovations, two of which are smart contracts in general purpose languages (chaincode in HLF), and exible endorsement policies, which govern whether a transaction is considered valid. Typical blockchain applications are comprised of two tiers: the rst tier focuses on the modelling of the data schema and embedding of business rules into the blockchain by means of smart contracts (chaincode) and endorsment policies; and the second tier uses the SDK (Software Development Kit) provided by HLF to implement client side application logic. However there is a gap between the two tiers that hinders the rapid adoption of changes in the chaincode and endorsement policies within the client SDK. Currently, the chaincode location and endorsement policies are statically congured into the client SDK. This limits the reliability and availability of the client in the event of changes in the platform, and makes the platform more dicult to use. In this work we address and bridge the gap by describing the design and implementation of Service Discovery. Service Discovery provides APIs which allow dynamic discovery of the conguration required for the client SDK to interact with the platform, alleviating the client from the burden of maintaining it. This enables the client to rapidly adapt to changes in the platform, thus signicantly improving the reliability of the application layer. It also makes the HLF platform more consumable, simplifying the job of creating blockchain applications. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

In today’s practice, most Blockchain smart contracts (which capture the business processing logic) are written primarily by software developers. To enable widespread adoption of Blockchain, business analysts and subject matter experts will need to have direct access to the smart contract logic, including the abilities to understand, modify, and create substantial portions of that logic. This paper describes a fully functioning framework and system for specifying and executing smart contracts in which the core logic is specified by a controlled English, business-level rules language. The framework includes a browser-based smart editor for rules; a parser generator that enables substantial variation in the rules syntax; code generation that maps to a RETE based rules engine; and execution of the rules in either on-chain (using Hyperledger Fabric) or off-chain modes. The paper describes the rules framework and possible extensions, and identifies key aspects of Blockchain that impact the implementation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

Thus, the proposed SC design will be significantly different from previous SC designs, not in programming languages to be used, but in the way SCs are designed and executed.

This data could represent cryptocurrencies but also sensor data or commands to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) connected to the Internet. To provide reliability, the contract code is enforced by consensus and the transactions it triggers are nonrevertible, even if they were not intended by the programmer, which could lead to dangerous system behavior. In this paper, we conduct a survey over existing smart contract platforms and languages to determine requirements for the design of a safer contract language. Subsequently we propose concepts that enhance the understanding of code by limiting confusing language constructs, such as nesting, arbitrary naming of operations, and unreadable hash identifiers. This enables human reasoning about the contract semantics on a much higher abstraction layer, because a common understanding can be derived from the language specification itself. We implement these concepts in a new domain specific language called SmaCoNat to illustrate the feasibility and show that our concepts are barely covered by existing languages but significantly enhance readability and safety without violating deterministic parsability. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org). Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing blockchain platforms that require “smart-contracts” to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks. This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a concept of autonomous blockchain based negotiation to select the most convenient electric vehicle charging station. The enabling blockchain technologies are well known fundament of cryptocurrencies, but offer many other possible applications areas, such as automated trusted machine-to-machine transactions, including auctions, bidding and payments. Compared to traditional centralized approaches, such a solution does not require any central entities and can be fully automated, including the payment for the energy. Based on e.g. the planned route, car battery status, real-time traffic information and drivers' preferences, a car could request charging bids from various charging stations along the route, by executing blockchain based smart contracts related to these charging stations. It would then select the most appropriate one based on offered prices, but other input parameters could be also taken into account, e.g. waiting times, estimated charging duration and alike. The smart contract execution could be extended to reservation and payment, too. In the paper we briefly present blockchain technologies, with the focus on Ethereum, and explain the role of smart contracts. We outline the architecture of a simple system for autonomous selection for electric vehicle charging station and provide a UML model to depict the activities of the actors involved in these operations and to clarify the role and the requirements of various blockchain related entities. The aim of our research paper is to outline a possible use-case for a blockchain prototype implementation. The implementation, which is not presented here, will serve for investigation of practical aspects of smart node development and operation, like transaction performance measurements, practical system requirement evaluations and comparison of reliability of various Ethereum clients. By our research we hope to support the investigation of novel applications and blending Internet of things with blockchain technologies, and in particular for elaboration of possible new use cases in the domain of electrical energy and mobility. © 2016 IEEE.},

In the symbolic model, participants act according to the semantics of BitML, while in the computational model they exchange bitstrings, and read/append transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. A compiler is provided to translate contracts into standard Bitcoin transactions. Participants can execute a contract by appending these transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, according to their strategies. We prove the correctness of our compiler, showing that computational attacks on compiled contracts are also observable in the symbolic model. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {The smart contract is an interdisciplinary concept that concerns business, finance, contract law and information technology. Designing and developing a smart contract may require the close cooperation of many experts coming from different fields. How to support such collaborative development is a challenging problem in blockchain-oriented software engineering. This paper proposes SPESC, a specification language for smart contracts, which can define the specification of a smart contract for the purpose of collaborative design. SPESC can specify a smart contract in a similar form to real-world contracts using a natural-language-like grammar, in which the obligations and rights of parties and the transaction rules of cryptocurrencies are clearly defined. The preliminary study results demonstrated that SPESC can be easily learned and understood by both IT and non-IT users and thus has greater potential to facilitate collaborative smart contract development. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contract applications based on Ethereum blockchain have been widely used in many fields. They are developed by professional developers using specialized programming languages like solidity. It requires high requirements on knowledge of the specialized field and the proficiency in contract programming. Thus, it is hard for normal users to design a usable smart contract based on their own demands. Most current studies about smart contracts focus on the security of coding while lack of friendly tools for users to design the specialized templates of contracts coding. This paper provides a visual and user-defined smart contract designing systems. It makes the development of domain-specific smart contracts simpler and visualization for contract users. The system implements the domain-specific features extraction about the crawled data sets of smart contract programs by TF-IDF and K-means++ clustering algorithm. Then, it achieves the automatic generation of unified basic function codes by Char-RNN (improved by LSTM) based on the domain-specific features. The system adopts Google Blockly and links the generated codes with UI controls. Finally, it provides a set of specialized templates of basic functions for users to design smart contracts by the friendly interface. It reduces the difficulty and costs of contract programming. The paper offers a case study to design contracts by users. The designed contracts were validated on the existing system to implement the food trading and traders' credit evaluation. The experimental results show that the designed smart contracts achieve good integration with the existing system and they can be deployed and compiled successfully. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This research addresses the issue that in-depth programming knowhow is needed to read and write smart contracts. The goal was making the creation of smart contracts accessible to non-computer experts by the use of a graphical programming language (Blockly). We used modularization to capture the complexity of legal contracts and developed a mapping process to transform the graphical representation to the smart contract programming language Solidity. We applied our approach to legal purchase agreements and proved the practicality of our solution and explored its limitations. A prototype was built to show the feasibility of our approach. Our industry partner challenged the prototype by applying it to the contract creation process. We consider our work as the first step towards an application of smart contracts in the non-IT world and outside the today's expert shaped ecosystem of blockchain specialists.

Aiming at this problem, we propose SMPC-based smart contract platform with three-layer structure: contract, computing, and group communication layer. In contract layer, we put forward SMPC-based smart contract framework, which gives the implementation process, language structure and grammar specification of smart contracts. In computing layer, fair SMPC algorithms based on general linear secret sharing scheme are designed to implement verifiable collaboration computing with input privacy and computation correctness. In group communication layer, the non-blocking broadcast is developed from non-blocking message passing interface (MPI)in order to ensure secure group communication in asynchronous networks with node and link failures. Finally, the results of simulation experiments with private currency transfers indicate that our platform is efficient and secure enough for common smart contracts. © 2018 IEEE.},
